    "content": "<p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it.</p><p>The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great mass, a black hole is not a cosmic vacuum cleaner; objects must be very close to be pulled in. They are a natural consequence of Einstein's theory of general relativity.</p>"
